# Core rules (JournalLink)

- Follow docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/PRODUCT.md as source of truth.
- Keep changes small. Prefer incremental PR-sized diffs.
- TypeScript only. Do not introduce `any` unless justified in a comment.
- Do not add new libraries unless you explain why and list alternatives.
- End every task with: (1) what changed, (2) how to run/verify.
