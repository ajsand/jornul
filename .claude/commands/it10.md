ITERATION 10 — Inbox jobs UI + pipeline skeleton (processing states)
SUBAGENTS: journalink-capture (lead), journalink-ui (support), journalink-qa (support)

PRIMARY GOAL
Users should see “what the app is doing” after capture: tagging/normalizing jobs show progress and status.

PREFLIGHT
1) Confirm jobs table exists from iter08.
2) Confirm Scratch enqueues a job from iter09.

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Create a job runner service (local in-app):
   - services/jobRunner.ts
   - picks pending jobs FIFO
   - runs job handlers (normalize, tag)
   - updates jobs.status/progress/error
B) Create Inbox screen:
   - app/(tabs)/inbox.tsx
   - list newest jobs + linked item preview
   - statuses: queued/running/done/failed
C) Add a simple “Normalize” handler:
   - for link items: parse domain, set source_domain, set title = domain for now
   - for note: compute basic stats (length) in media_meta.extra_json

QA
- Create 3 items; confirm 3 jobs appear; confirm they transition to done.
- Ensure runner is safe: no infinite loop, handles app backgrounding.

DELIVERABLES
- Inbox screen + job runner skeleton.
- Commit: "iter10: inbox jobs + pipeline skeleton"
