ITERATION 26 — Store submission checklist + hardening
SUBAGENTS: journalink-release (lead), journalink-qa (support), journalink-privacy (support)

PRIMARY GOAL
Finalize for submission:
- crash-free, fast, no broken screens
- privacy policy + data handling disclosures complete
- submission steps documented

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Add docs/STORE_SUBMISSION.md:
   - iOS: bundle id, TestFlight flow
   - Android: package name, internal testing track
   - how to run EAS Submit
B) Add “App Review Mode” setting:
   - disables cloud providers unless a test key is provided
   - uses local-only insights fallback (safe demo)
C) Hardening:
   - error boundaries for every major screen
   - safe DB fallback if migration fails (show “repair” guidance)

QA
- Full regression checklist executed.
- Build artifacts created and ready to submit.

DELIVERABLES
- Repo is ready for store upload.
- Commit: "iter26: store submission checklist + hardening"
