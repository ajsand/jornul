ITERATION 07 — Baseline verification + docs scaffold (lock the foundation)
SUBAGENTS: journalink-architect (lead), journalink-qa (support)

PRIMARY GOAL
Verify current repo is structurally correct for JournalLink (Expo Router + local-first SQLite) and create the missing product/architecture/roadmap docs so the rest of iterations stay aligned.

PREFLIGHT (MUST DO FIRST)
1) Detect package manager (pnpm/yarn/npm) via lockfile and use it consistently.
2) Run: install deps, typecheck, lint, and boot app on at least one platform.
3) Confirm Expo Router structure: app/ directory, _layout.tsx usage, tabs if applicable. Expo Router layouts are defined via _layout.tsx. 
4) Create a short “current state report” in docs/STATUS.md: what screens exist, what DB exists, what stores exist, what is missing.

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Create docs folder + seed docs with real content (not placeholders):
   - docs/PRODUCT.md (user flows, modes, privacy defaults, cloud opt-in)
   - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (modules, DB schema, pipelines)
   - docs/ROADMAP.md (iterations 07–26 list + acceptance criteria)
   - docs/PRIVACY.md (local-first, compare capsule minimization, keys on device)
B) Add a “Definition of Done” checklist template in docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
C) Add a “Dev workflow” section: how to run dev build vs Expo Go (important later for native deps).

QA TASKS
- journalink-qa: confirm docs reflect the intended architecture (Scratch → Inbox jobs → Vault; AETS emergent tags; Swipe Deck; Sync + Consent + Insights; cloud optional).

DELIVERABLES
- Docs created and accurate.
- App still boots after changes.
- Commit: "iter07: baseline verification + docs scaffold"
