ITERATION 16 — Swipe Deck v1 (catalog + swipe events + filters)
SUBAGENTS: journalink-swipe (lead), journalink-ui (support), journalink-db (support), journalink-qa (support)

PRIMARY GOAL
Add Swipe tab with a card deck UI, media-type filters, and persistence of swipe decisions.

PREFLIGHT
1) Confirm swipe_media/swipe_sessions/swipe_events tables exist.
2) Decide where catalog comes from for MVP:
   - local JSON seed shipped in repo (recommended for now)

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Seed swipe_media:
   - add scripts/seedSwipeCatalog.ts or on-first-run seeding
   - include fields: title, type, image_url (or local image), short_desc, tags_json, popularity_score
B) Swipe UI:
   - app/(tabs)/swipe.tsx
   - filter row (Books, Movies, TV, Podcasts, Games, Music, YouTube Creators, Documentaries, Stand-up, Sports Events, Essays, Public Figures)
   - card shows big image + title + descriptor
   - actions: Like / Dislike / Neutral / Super-like (buttons + gestures)
C) Persist:
   - create swipe_session at session start
   - record swipe_event per card

QA
- Swipe 50 times, relaunch app, confirm history exists.
- Filters show correct subset.

DELIVERABLES
- Swipe Deck functional.
- Commit: "iter16: swipe deck v1 + catalog + events"
