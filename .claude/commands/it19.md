ITERATION 19 — Themes view (clusters of tags) + tag merge UX
SUBAGENTS: journalink-aets (lead), journalink-ui (support), journalink-db (support), journalink-qa (support)

PRIMARY GOAL
Create “Themes” as clusters of emergent tags and provide UX to merge/rename/refine.

PREFLIGHT
1) Confirm tags/tag_assignments exist and have data.
2) Confirm AETS can compute similarity (heuristic or embeddings if enabled).

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Add clustering:
   - services/aets/cluster.ts
   - heuristic: group tags by co-occurrence across items, and/or prefix similarity
   - if embeddings enabled: use cosine similarity + simple threshold
B) Persist clusters:
   - clusters + cluster_members tables
C) Themes UI:
   - app/(tabs)/themes.tsx
   - show theme name (auto) + top tags + item count
   - tap theme → list items
D) Tag merge flow:
   - from tag management: select two tags → merge into one (migrate assignments)
   - keep synonym record

QA
- Themes look sensible after 100+ items.
- Merge does not break search or assignments.

DELIVERABLES
- Themes screen shipped.
- Commit: "iter19: themes + tag merge ux"
