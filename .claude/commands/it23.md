ITERATION 23 — Insights UI + evidence mapping + session history
SUBAGENTS: journalink-ui (lead), journalink-sync (support), journalink-db (support), journalink-qa (support)

PRIMARY GOAL
Render Insight Cards cleanly and store session history locally.

PREFLIGHT
1) iter22 returns Insight JSON with evidence ids/pointers.
2) session_ledger table exists.

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Insights tab:
   - app/(tabs)/insights.tsx shows list of past sessions
B) Insight detail:
   - app/insights/[id].tsx renders:
     - Shared topics
     - Differences
     - Suggested questions
     - Curiosities
C) Evidence mapping:
   - show “why” with references to local items or tag/theme summaries
   - do not show raw partner data beyond what was consented

QA
- Past sessions load fast.
- Insight rendering never crashes on missing optional fields.

DELIVERABLES
- Insights are usable as the “conversation starter” screen.
- Commit: "iter23: insights ui + session history"
