ITERATION 24 — Share-to-app ingestion (deep link now, share intent later)
SUBAGENTS: journalink-capture (lead), journalink-architect (support), journalink-qa (support)

PRIMARY GOAL
Make “capture from other apps” realistic for production.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT
expo-sharing does NOT support registering your app as a share target (inbound share) by itself; it only shares outward. For inbound sharing you need native share extensions/intents via custom native work or a module. 

MVP PLAN
Phase A (this iteration): implement robust deep-link ingestion:
- jornallink://capture?text=... or ?url=...
Phase B (later): add native share intent module + dev build.

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Add deep link route:
   - app/capture.tsx reads query params and calls ingest pipeline
B) Add a “Share” button inside app:
   - exports deep link and copies to clipboard for quick use
C) Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with the inbound share plan and why it needs native tooling.

QA
- Tapping a deep link creates an item and enqueues jobs.
- No regressions in Scratch.

DELIVERABLES
- Deep link capture works reliably.
- Commit: "iter24: deep link capture ingestion"
