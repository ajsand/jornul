ITERATION 20 — Sync v1 (in-person QR handshake + signature exchange)
SUBAGENTS: journalink-sync (lead), journalink-privacy (support), journalink-qa (support)

PRIMARY GOAL
Implement a simple in-person sync handshake for MVP:
- show QR that encodes a short-lived “signature payload”
- scan QR to import the other person’s signature into a local “session”

PREFLIGHT
1) Decide MVP approach: QR-only exchange (no P2P yet).
2) Confirm you have a way to scan QR (expo-camera or a QR module).

SIGNATURE CONTENT (MINIMIZED)
- theme distribution summary (top themes + scores)
- top liked/disliked swipe tags summary
- counts only; no raw notes
- a session nonce + timestamp

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Build signature generator:
   - services/sync/signature.ts
B) Sync screen:
   - app/(tabs)/sync.tsx
   - “Show my QR”
   - “Scan QR”
C) Create local “sync_session” state:
   - store partner signature + local signature for later capsule building

PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS
- no raw journal content in QR
- include expiration timestamp and refuse stale signatures

QA
- Two devices can exchange QR and land in “Consent” next step placeholder.

DELIVERABLES
- QR sync v1 works.
- Commit: "iter20: sync v1 qr handshake + signatures"
