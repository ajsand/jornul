ITERATION 09 — Scratch capture v1 (Paste & Save, zero-friction)
SUBAGENTS: journalink-ui (lead), journalink-capture (support), journalink-qa (support)

PRIMARY GOAL
Build the Scratch screen: user can paste text/URL and save instantly. This is the core “seamless capture” entry point.

PREFLIGHT
1) Inspect navigation: ensure a stable Tabs layout exists (or create one).
2) Confirm there is a place to add a new screen route under app/ (Expo Router).

UI REQUIREMENTS
Scratch screen must support:
- Big input box (multiline)
- One tap “Paste” reads clipboard
- One tap “Save”
- Auto-detect if content looks like URL vs plain text
- Immediately creates an item row + job row (tagging job later)

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Add route: app/(tabs)/scratch.tsx (or equivalent)
B) Clipboard integration using expo-clipboard getStringAsync(). (Docs exist for getStringAsync usage.) 
C) Add “type detection”:
   - if URL: kind = link, url = pasted, title temp
   - else: kind = note, text = pasted
D) Insert item into DB via itemsRepo; enqueue a job: jobsRepo.enqueue("normalize_and_tag", {itemId})

QA
- Confirm user can paste and save in <3 taps.
- Confirm item shows in DB (build a temporary “Debug Items List” if needed).

DELIVERABLES
- Scratch screen usable.
- Commit: "iter09: scratch paste & save v1"
