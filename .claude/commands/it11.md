ITERATION 11 — Mass upload v1 (multi-select + batch jobs)
SUBAGENTS: journalink-ui (lead), journalink-capture (support), journalink-db (support), journalink-qa (support)

PRIMARY GOAL
Add a “Mass Upload” action to import multiple files at once, enqueue jobs for each, and show a batch progress row.

PREFLIGHT
1) Confirm Inbox exists and jobs runner works.
2) Confirm document/media pickers currently used (if any).

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Add a Mass Upload entry point:
   - Button on Scratch and/or Vault: “Import Files”
B) Use expo-document-picker to select multiple files when supported.
C) For each selected file:
   - create items row (kind inferred: image/pdf/audio/video/unknown)
   - store mime + uri reference in media_meta.extra_json
   - enqueue job normalize_and_tag for each
D) Add batch job tracking:
   - jobs.kind = "batch_import"
   - payload holds child job ids
   - Inbox shows batch progress: done/total

QA
- Import 5+ files; ensure app remains responsive and jobs complete.
- Confirm no crashes when user cancels picker.

DELIVERABLES
- Mass upload works, Inbox shows progress.
- Commit: "iter11: mass upload v1 + batch jobs"
