# This is a placeholder for the ONNX model file
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary ONNX model file
# For MVP demonstration purposes, this stub file represents where
# the actual embedding model would be stored

# TODO: Replace with actual tiny embedding model (e.g., MiniLM-lite)
# Expected size: ~5KB for a minimal 128-dimension model
# The model should take text input and output 128-dimensional embeddings
